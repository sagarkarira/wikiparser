  "readme": "# Compound File Binary Format \n\nThis is a Pure-JS implementation of MS-CFB: Compound File Binary File Format, a\nformat used in many Microsoft file types (such as XLS, DOC, and other Microsoft\nOffice file types). \n\n# Utility Installation and Usage\n\nThe package is available on NPM:\n\n```\n$ npm install -g cfb\n$ cfb path/to/CFB/file\n```\n\nThe command will extract the storages and streams in the container, generating\nfiles that line up with the tree-based structure of the storage.  Metadata \nsuch as the red-black tree are discarded (and in the future, new CFB containers\nwill exclusively use black nodes)\n\n# Library Installation and Usage\n\nIn the browser:\n\n    <script src=\"cfb.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\nIn node:\n\n    var CFB = require('cfb');\n\nFor example, to get the Workbook content from an XLS file:\n\n    var cfb = CFB.read(filename, {type: 'file'});\n    var workbook = cfb.find('Workbook')\n\n# API\n\nTypescript definitions are maintained in `misc/cfb.d.ts`.\n\nThe CFB object exposes the following methods and properties:\n\n`CFB.parse(blob)` takes a nodejs Buffer or an array of bytes and returns an\nparsed representation of the data.\n\n`CFB.read(blob, options)` wraps `parse`.  `options.type` controls the behavior:\n\n- `file`: `blob` should be a file name\n- `base64`: `blob` should be a base64 string\n- `binary`: `blob` should be a binary string\n\n## Container Object Description\n\nThe object returned by `parse` and `read` can be found in the source (`rval`).\nIt has the following properties and methods:\n\n- `.find(path)` performs a case-insensitive match for the path (or file name, if\n  there are no slashes) and returns an entry object (described later) or null if\n  not found \n\n- `.FullPaths` is an array of the names of all of the streams (files) and \n  storages (directories) in the container.  The paths are properly prefixed from\n  the root entry (so the entries are unique)\n\n- `.FullPathDir` is an object whose keys are entries in `.FullPaths` and whose\n  values are objects with metadata and content (described below)\n\n- `.FileIndex` is an array of the objects from `.FullPathDir`, in the same order\n  as `.FullPaths`.\n\n- `.raw` contains the raw header and sectors \n\n## Entry Object Description\n\nThe entry objects are available from `FullPathDir` and `FileIndex` elements of the \ncontainer object.\n\n- `.name` is the (case sensitive) internal name\n- `.type` is the type (`stream` for files, `storage` for dirs, `root` for root)\n- `.content` is a Buffer/Array with the raw content\n- `.ct`/`.mt` are the creation and modification time (if provided in file)\n\n# Notes\n\nCase comparison has not been verified for non-ASCII character\n\nWriting is not supported.  It is in the works, but it has not yet been released.\n\n# License\n\nThis implementation is covered under Apache 2.0 license.  It complies with the\n[Open Specifications Promise](http://www.microsoft.com/openspecifications/)\n\n",
